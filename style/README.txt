To do your assignment, start witht the oldstyle.css code.  You should rename it style.css which is the name linked to in the html.

The CSS is to be your own design.  It is ok to discuss and observe and take ideas from other css files, but your css should be your own creation.  
If it is excessively similar to existing css or other student's css, then it will be viewed as plagiarism.
